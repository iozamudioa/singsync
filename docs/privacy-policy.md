# SingSync Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2026-02-20

This Privacy Policy explains how SingSync processes data when you use the app.

## 1) Data we process

SingSync may process the following data strictly to provide core functionality:

- Music playback metadata from notification access (for example: track title, artist, and source app package name).
- Search queries used to retrieve lyrics.
- App-generated snapshot images only when you explicitly choose to save/share them.

## 2) Why we process data

We process data only to:

- Detect current playing track.
- Fetch and display lyrics.
- Enable user-requested actions (save/share snapshots).

## 3) Third-party services

SingSync sends lyric lookup requests to LRCLIB endpoints to retrieve lyrics and related metadata.

## 4) Data sharing and selling

- We do not sell personal data.
- We do not use notification access for advertising personalization.

## 5) Data storage and retention

- Snapshot images are stored on your device gallery when you explicitly choose to save them.
